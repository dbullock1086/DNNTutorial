This repository contains some scripts useful for an ATLAS tutorial on Deep Neural Networks (DDN). There are also three copies of the tutorial to guide you through use of the software:
- A Markdown file located at `docs/DNNTutorial.md`
- An HTML file located at `docs/DNNTutorial.html`
- A [twiki page](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasComputing/SoftwareTutorialDeepLearning) for ATLAS software
